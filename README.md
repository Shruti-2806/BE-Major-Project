This project is an **Interview Preparation Platform** that helps users improve their coding, aptitude, and core subject skills, along with mock interviews to simulate real interview processes. The platform includes various modules, from coding practice to theory and gamification, providing a comprehensive experience for users to enhance their problem-solving abilities and interview performance.

## Features

The platform consists of the following features:

1. **Login/Signup Page**:
   - Allows users to register or log in to access the platform.

2. **Landing Page**:
   - Acts as the central hub where users can navigate to different sections like Mock Interviews, Coding Practice, Core Subjects, Gamification, and Aptitude tests.

3. **Mock Interview**:
   - Simulates real-world interview processes with multiple rounds:
     - **Round 1**: DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) and Core Subjects.
     - **Round 2**: Questions based on the user’s resume.
     - **Round 3**: HR-related questions to mimic a real interview experience.

4. **Coding Practice**:
   - Users can select a topic of their choice.
   - After solving problems, their code is evaluated based on:
     - Correctness
     - Optimality
     - Points are awarded based on the number of test cases passed.

5. **Core Subjects**:
   - Theory and Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for subjects like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and more.

6. **Gamification**:
   - Introduces a fun, competitive element through the “Fastest Finger's First” quiz, where users can compete against each other in solving questions quickly.

7. **Aptitude**:
   - Users can select a specific topic for aptitude questions.
   - Includes MCQs based on the selected topic, designed to enhance logical thinking and problem-solving.
